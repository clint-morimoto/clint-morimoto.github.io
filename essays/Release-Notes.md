*Latest Update: February 1, 2017*
<br/>
I have nearly completed the walk cycle animation for the protagonist of the game.  I wanted to be finished with this task by now, I think that my OCD tendencies with visual stuff is getting the better of me here, but I believe this task will be completed within a week, and the controllable sprite animation will be imported into a very basic test stage (simply the character on a plain background that can be controlled).

## Newtonium
Welcome to my Release Notes page for Project Newtonium!  Newtonium is the working title of a physics learning game to be developed in Unity.  The target audience of this project is high school to college level students who are either interested in, or required to take an introductory pre-engineering physics course.  The goal of this project is to act as either a spark or a catalyst for interest in classical mechanics (applications of newton's laws and other topics) through the use of some traditional video game elements including a dialogue-driven story, animated graphics, and music.

One week into a 15-week period of time allotted to this project, the focus has been largely on the planning of how to best use the remaining 14 weeks towards completion of the project.  I have skimmed through a number of courses on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/courses/) and YouTube that feature Unity development related to this project, and while it appears that I cannot yet accurately finalize which courses will be the best to focus on, I am fairly confident that [this course](https://www.udemy.com/unity2dplatformer/) and [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=unity+rpg+tutorial+gamesplusjames) will teach me techniques that I can use in a similar fashion for the implementation of my game.  Specifically, the animation and manipulation of 2D sprite-based characters for the first series, and the use of dialogue boxes involving multiple characters from the second instructional video set.

Pictured above are storyboards for the introduction to the game.  Eventually I would like to have a title screen and possibly an additional introductory screen or two, but this is the main part of the introduction of our main character and the story he partakes in that motivates the solving of physics problems.  The working plot summary is that Main, our protagonist, lives in a fictional universe where he is part of a military academy.  Immediately the military base he occupies is under attack, and he is introduced to the first of many situations where he must use physics to get through his dilemma.  The idea for the story following this introductory level, is that Main's world will have been changed drastically following this sudden outbreak of war, and the new world is ravaged and full of people in need and being oppressed by the militia that remains after the fallout.  Main and his sidekick Cascopter decide that they will not harm anyone in this new world, and will instead use their abilities with physics to save as many people as they can.

### Goals for March 1, 2017:
I am setting this date as a working deadline to get a playable demo up of Newtonium.  My definition of playable is the execution of the type of problem solving sceraio introduced in the second and third storyboard above, as well as a working, if not finalized, introduction scene shown in storyboards 1 and 2.  I am looking at other Udemy video courses that I have purchased as being ones to invest my time on over this period, and hope to have decided on this before the next milestone.  I am taking a page out of the book from out curriculum from the computer science course [ICS 314, Software Engineering](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/), where we spent considerable time learning a variety of skills in the first half of the course, which we proceeded to utilize in a large final project.  My plan isn't to mirror this approach, but I want to similarly focus on skill development for at least the first month of this project period, while also working on areas that I have existing competence in (character design and animation using pixel-based sprites, and level design).
