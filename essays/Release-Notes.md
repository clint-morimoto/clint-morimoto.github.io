## Newtonium
Welcome to my Release Notes page for Project Newtonium!  Newtonium is the working title of a physics learning game to be developed in Unity.  The target audience of this project is high school to college level students who are either interested in, or required to take an introductory pre-engineering physics course.  The goal of this project is to act as either a spark or a catalyst for interest in classical mechanics (applications of newton's laws and other topics) through the use of some traditional video game elements including a dialogue-driven story, animated graphics, and music.

*January 16, 2017*
One week into a 15-week period of time allotted to this project, the focus has been largely on the planning of how to best use the remaining 14 weeks towards completion of the project.  
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) held strong appeal.

I did feel at times like I was searching for a unicorn while trying to understand how the code worked in [some of the  Meteor tutorials](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/meteor-1/experience-meteor-blaze-tutorial.html) I was exposed to.  It turned out, certainly in my case, that Meteor has a pretty steep learning curve.

## Directories, Directories Everywhere

There are a lot of programming structure in Meteor that in practice were a bit shell-shocking to encounter all at once, despite how in theory, it makes sound sense: JavaScript handles all of the "database stuff", and other programming logic, which HTML refers to when it needs to through the use of templates.  Templates are referenced in HTML through a seemingly easy-enough syntax called [SpaceBars](http://blazejs.org/guide/spacebars.html), and taken separately, each "piece" of Meteor does seem very comprehendable.  My big issue was that seemingly many, many new pieces are introduced (and necessary) all at once in order to make something that actually works in Meteor.  In particular, the current best practice of separating code into many different subdirectories with import statements needed to connect them all, threw me for a loop.

## It's a Big First Step

After two week of getting hit by Meteor, it is starting to feel more (although not yet) comfortable.  Simply plowing forward and fooling around with tutorial code to see what happens when you change this or that, has led to personal progress.  In particular, [this tutorial](http://meteortips.com/first-meteor-tutorial/) was very helpful all putting all of the pieces together, despite being written with an earlier version of Meteor in mind.  I now believe that it will be a fair amount of time before I can put my own web app dreams into full gear, but it is a small victory that within a couple weeks, what once seemed possibly insurmountable now seems difficult, yet possible.
