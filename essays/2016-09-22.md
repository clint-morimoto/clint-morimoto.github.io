Coding standards in programming has generally been something I have felt enthusiasm towards that ranged between lukewarm and cold.  It reminded me of constructs such as proper grammar; a standard that exists for maintaining conformity in communication, yet having to follow all of the rules of a coding standard can be pretty annoying!  Just like being able to say things like "Me and my friend" instead of "My friend and I", I like being able to put multiple blank lines in between lines of code, indent code blocks more than two spaces in, etc.  However, considering the fact that software engineering usually involves working in teams rather than individually, I believe that coding standards are necessary to maintain an efficient process of sharing and co-writing programs with a number of other people.

## Lint Is Useful!

*Those colored squiggly lines mean I have errors?  All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead...*

This week in software engineering marked the first time we used the IntelliJ IDE, and along with it we used a popular quality assurance tool for maintaining a coding standard in JavaScript, in ESLint.  [Installing ESLint for IntelliJ](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/morea/coding-standards/experience-install-eslint.html) kind of blew my mind, but thankfully utilizing it proved to be not as difficult.  ESLint shows coding standard errors by underlining your code in a way similar to how Microsoft Word marks grammatical or spelling errors, via red squiggly underlines.

*All that red?  Really?*

It takes a little while to get used to your code looking like an English paper rough draft that got the extreme red marker treatment, but if you keep in mind that your code will usually look that way until you finish your program, ESLint seems like a great tool to remind you of how to maintain the JS code standard.  I would like it if there existed an autocorrect feature for cases where the code would execute the same way regardless, e.g. things like using single quotes instead of double quotes for all JavaScript strings.

## Good Thing Billy Knows How To Type Now, His Handwriting Sucks

Although maintaining coding standards may never light my world on fire regardless of how sophisticated the tools for doing so become, it helps when I keep in mind that maintaining a standard ensures a project team of programmers will have a degree of conformity when it comes to looking at other people's code, and writing code that others can more easily interpret.  It is perhaps likely that given a large group of programmers, someone will have a personal coding style that is difficult for another team member to decipher.  Having a coding standard can only help to alleviate such situations.
