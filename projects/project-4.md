<a href="https://brain-food.github.io/">Brain Food</a> is a web application aimed at giving students nutrition ideas for the purpose of better brainpower.  Quality nutrition is a key component for cognitive performance, yet is something easily overlooked by college students who are living independently and often strapped for both time and money.  By offering a growing database of both healthy recipe ideas and locations where ingredients and meals can be purchased, Brain Food gives students a resource for improving their quality of nutrition.

This was our final project for an introductory Software Engineering course at the University of Manoa.
