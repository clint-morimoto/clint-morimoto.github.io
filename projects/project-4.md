<a href="https://brain-food.github.io/">Brain Food</a> is a web application aimed at giving students nutrition ideas for the purpose of better brainpower.  Quality nutrition is a key component for cognitive performance, yet is something easily overlooked by college students who are living independently and often strapped for both time and money.  By offering a growing database of both healthy recipe ideas and locations where ingredients and meals can be purchased, Brain Food gives students a resource for improving their quality of nutrition.

This was our final project for an introductory Software Engineering course at the University of Manoa.  I worked on the application's video game sprite-inspired graphics and the general site design.  I also was able to create a working comment function for users to add comments regarding a particular food location, using Meteor's MongoDB database format.  This was made possible through the Meteor lessons provided to us in the course, and also with a lot of assistance from my teammate Kea Uehara.  It was an excellent experience working with both Kea and my other teammates Steven Braun and Riley Miyamoto, who all contributed a ton to this project and made it possible.  As of December 2016 the project is not yet complete in regards to being ready for a public release, but many features are working properly including CRUD functionality for recipe documents (database records in MongoDB).
