Brain Food is a web application aimed at giving students nutrition ideas for the purpose of better brainpower.  Quality nutrition is a key component for cognitive performance, yet is something easily overlooked by college students who are living independently and often strapped for both time and money.

This was an individual project coded in Java, HTML and CSS.  It was worked on for a Databases course under the Computer Science department at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  This was the first project I worked on that involved both an interactive website, and linking it to a database.  It was extremely challenging with my inexperience, and I was unable to accomplish the larger scale vision previously mentioned.  I was, however, able to create a version that could pull media files for the images and sounds from a local database.
