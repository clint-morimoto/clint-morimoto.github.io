As an aspiring computer scientist with very limited experience with web application development, let alone web app frameworks, the idea of [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) held strong appeal: a way to build professional grade web applications for both home computer and mobile devices, all with one language (JavaScript).  I had some exposure to Meteor in the past but never fully invested myself in it until recently, and I was excited to begin a journey towards making a cool web application with my own semi-unique idea behind it all.  Now?  Those dreams have been crushed, along with my soul.  Kidding, but I did indeed get a tough reality check upon realizing that while Meteor may be a faster, possibly better way than most for building a web app *full stack* (from the user interface/client side front end, to the server side back end), it's not a miracle of immediate ease of use and productivity.
